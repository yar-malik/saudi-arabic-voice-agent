# Saudi Arabic Voice Agent

> Build a phone agent that speaks Najdi Saudi Arabic, understands the caller, and completes the request in your own systems.

Built for Saudi Arabia. The voices are trained around **Najdi Arabic** — the
dialect spoken in Riyadh and central Saudi Arabia — with Gulf, Egyptian and
Modern Standard Arabic also available, plus English and Arabic/English
code-switching in the same sentence.

## What this does

- Answer inbound calls in Saudi Arabic, including the Najdi dialect spoken across Riyadh and central Saudi Arabia.
- Stream audio in mulaw at 8 kHz, which is what Cisco, Avaya and SIP trunks carry — no transcoding on your side.
- Hand a call to a human with the caller identity, the summary and every action already taken.

## Quick start

You need a Voho API key. Create one at [app.voho.ai](https://app.voho.ai) under **API Tokens**.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yar-malik/saudi-arabic-voice-agent.git
cd saudi-arabic-voice-agent
cp .env.example .env      # then paste your key into .env
```

### Node.js

```bash
npm install
node examples/node/index.mjs
```

### Python

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python examples/python/main.py
```

Both examples answer a caller reporting a broken air conditioner, then raise the service request.

## Arabic voices

| Voice | Dialect | Gender | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `layla` | **Najdi** | female | Warm Riyadh delivery. The default for reception and appointments. |
| `nouf` | **Najdi** | female | Measured and senior. Collections, escalations, compliance scripts. |
| `faisal` | **Najdi** | male | Even and authoritative. Reads long policy text well. |
| `omar` | **Najdi** | male | Bright and quick. Outbound offers and short confirmations. |
| `reem` | Gulf | female | Lighter Gulf accent, conversational. |
| `khalid` | Modern Standard | male | Broadcast register. Announcements and IVR trees. |
| `maha` | Egyptian | female | Unhurried and reassuring. |
| `yousef` | Modern Standard | male | Neutral. Safest when the caller's dialect is unknown. |


List them live:

```bash
curl "https://app.voho.ai/v1/voices?dialect=najdi" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $VOHO_API_KEY"
```

## Audio formats

| Format | Sample rate | Use it for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mulaw` | 8 kHz | **Telephony.** What Cisco, Avaya and SIP trunks carry. No transcoding. |
| `mp3` | 24 kHz | Files, playback, storage. |
| `wav` | 24 kHz | Editing and processing. |
| `opus` | 24 kHz | Streaming to a browser. Lowest time to first audio. |

## Streaming

For live calls, first-audio latency is what gets measured. Streaming returns
audio while the sentence is still being produced:

```bash
curl -N -X POST "https://app.voho.ai/v1/speech/stream" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $VOHO_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text":"أهلاً بك","voice":"layla","format":"opus"}' --output out.ogg
```

A WebSocket endpoint at `wss://app.voho.ai/v1/speech/ws` accepts text
incrementally, so an LLM can stream tokens in while audio streams out.

## Running inside your own network

Saudi enterprises frequently require that data does not leave the building.
Every Voho product can run on your own servers, in a private section of your
cloud, or in a Saudi data centre — including with no internet connection at
all. Point `VOHO_BASE_URL` at your own deployment and nothing else changes.

## Security

- No key is committed here. `.env` is git-ignored; `.env.example` holds
  placeholders only.
- Rotate keys from the dashboard. Only a hash is stored server-side, so a
  leaked database does not hand anyone a working credential.
- Scope one key per environment.
